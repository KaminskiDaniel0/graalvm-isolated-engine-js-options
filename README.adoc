When running the Application.java two contexts with slightly different engine configurations get created and evaluated.
The first context will evaluate without error and write two log statements to the stdout and err ByteArrayOutputStreams.

The second context with its engine will not even get created because the attempt to try and change "js.xyz" settings is not permitted in the `SandboxPolicy.ISOLATED` (or any `SandboxPolicy` that is stricter than `TRUSTED` for that matter)
